## 🧠 PySpark Masterclass – From Zero to Pro

This repository contains my complete PySpark Masterclass – a comprehensive, hands-on journey through Apache Spark using Python in Databricks. Designed for both beginners and intermediate learners, it covers real-world data engineering workflows with fully functional code examples.

### 💡 What’s Inside:
- ✅ Data ingestion using CSV/JSON
- 📄 Schema design: DDL & StructType
- 🔁 Transformations: `select`, `filter`, `withColumn`, `alias`, etc.
- 🧹 Null handling, type casting, and sorting
- 🧮 Aggregations, groupBy, pivot, `collect_list`
- 🔗 Joins (inner, left, right, anti)
- 🪟 Window functions: row_number, rank, cumulative sums
- 🧪 UDFs (User Defined Functions)
- 💾 Writing to CSV, Parquet, and managed tables
- 🧾 Spark SQL & Temp Views integration

Everything is organized by topic, with clean code and live examples ready to run in Databricks notebooks.

📚 Ideal for data engineers, analysts, and anyone looking to master PySpark through practical experience.
